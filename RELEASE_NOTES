modbus-R2-2-lcls3: Build with asyn-R4-18-lcls1_OLD_IPAC
                   Needed to use another version asyn due to 
                   IPAC dependency in Magnet App; also the IPAC 
                   software module versions need to be reconciled

modbus-R2-2-lcls2: 
Build with asyn version: asyn-R4-18-lcls1

modbus-R2-2-lcls1: 
Modbus Support from Mark Rivers with site specific mods to support SLAC build system.
R2-0 introduced a 20 ms delay before each Modbus write. 
This was not correct, delays should only be needed for serial RTU. 
The Modicon Modbus Protocol Reference Guide says this must be at 
least 3.5 character times, e.g. about 3.5ms at 9600 baud, for Serial RTU. 
An additional writeDelayMsec parameter was added to modbusInterposeConfig. 
It is the final parameter, so if it is not specified the default value is zero, 
which is appropriate when not using Serial RTU. 
In the startup script lines like the following:
    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000)
    
should be changed to:

    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000,0)
    
for no delay, or to:

    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000,20)
    
for a 20 ms delay.
